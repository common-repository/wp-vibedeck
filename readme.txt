== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does it cost? =

Nothing!  

* The VibeDeck service is free and charges no fees. You set the price and you keep all the money. 

* The WP-VibeDeck plugin is free.

* The only fees you will incur are the PayPal transaction fees when someone makes a purchase.

= What are all the shortcode parameters? =

`[vibedeck artist="ARTIST_NAME" album="ALBUM_NUMBER" width="###" height="###" style="STYLE"]`

* ARTIST_NAME is the VibeDeck artist name.  For example, `artist="my-artist-name"`

* ALBUM_NUMBER will be a number.  For example, `album="55402"`

* width and height are numbers, given without units.  For example, `width="500"`

* STYLE is the desired player style, either "default" or "artwork".  If not specified, "default" is used.

= How do I change the style, colors, etc of the player? =

The player is generated by VibeDeck and is styled through that account.  The `<div>` surrounding the VibeDeck uses the `vibedeck-wrapper` class and can receive minimal styling like `border` and `float`.

`<style> 
	/* This Will float the VibeDeck to the left and give it an orange border. */
	.vibedeck-wrapper { border:10px solid #F90; float: left; } 

	/* This won't do anything because the font is controlled within the VibeDeck account. */
	.vibedeck-wrapper { font-size:24px; }
</style>` 

= What if I have more than one album? =

VibeDeck will allow you to create multiple albums, each with a unique album number.  Save your artist name on the plugin settings, and just specifiy the album number for the shortcode:  `[vibedeck album="####"]`

= What if my album has a lot of tracks and doesn't fit in the player window? =

Use the height parameter in the shortcode: `[vibedeck height="900"]` or some other big number. 

= Can I have more than one player on a screen? =

Sure, you can have multiple players on a page, in a post, or have one player in each post and list them all in an archive.  Multiple sidebar widgets are also allowed.
